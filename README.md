# Navigating through a Pokemon database with Python
For this exercise, I just wanted to navigate through the Pokemon database using python. It is very important to know how to locate specific data, especially in a large database, and Python is a powerful tool for this performance. In this context, I have started with loading data into pandas, which helped me perform actions like reading headers, reading all the rows in a specific column, read specific rows, read specific locations, parse through rows, identify categories with a conditional statement (Pokemon that are Fire-Type in my example), and a statistical summary).  Personally, I am not really into Pokemon, but for those who are, this could be of great type, especially to identify which type of Pokemon to use to maximize your chances to win. Enjoy!
